Summary

	This is a C++ implementation of the DCPU16 from Mojang's game 0x10c.
	It is based on the 1.7 specification (see doc directory).
	0x10c's website : http://0x10c.com/

Current features

	- DASM16 assembler
	- Hardware commands
	- Interrupts
	- LEM1802 emulation (changing palette/border color is not supported yet)
	- Generic Keyboard emulation
	- CPU state display with an overlay by hitting TAB
	- Auto textual memory dump before and after running
	- Font image converter (image 128x32 ==> DASM code)

Planned features

	- More hardware devices (Generic clock, custom speakers...)
	- Better support for implemented hardware devices
	- Debug tools / disassembler
	- IDE?

Compiling / dependencies
		
	SFML 1.6 : http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php

	Not available for now, I should upload Linux binaries soon.
	Windows binaries will come after for stable releases only.

How to use

	dcpu yourFile
		# Will assemble yourFile and run it
		
	dcpu -cvf yourImage yourDASMFile
		# Converts an font image (128x32 px) into DASM code (dat 0xstuff).
		# fonts are read as white pixels.
		
	dcpu
		# Prints an error (print help later)
